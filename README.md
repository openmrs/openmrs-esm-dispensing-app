* "Task: dispensing.create.dispense" - Allows user to Dispense Medication
* "Task: dispensing.create.dispense.andModifyDetails" - Allows user to modify the Quantity, Drug, Formulation and Dose Instructions (from the values specified in the Order / Medication Request) when Dispensing
* "Task: dispensing.edit.dispense" - Allows user to edit an existing Medication Dispense
* "Task: dispensing.delete.dispense" - Allows user to delete an existing Medication Dispense

## Running this code

```sh
yarn  # to install dependencies
yarn start --backend "http://localhost:8080/" --port 8081 # will run against a local OpenMRS server at localhost:8080, serving the frontend from 8081
```

Open a browser, pointing the the port indicated above (eg. 8081):
`http://localhost:8081/openmrs/spa/dispensing`
